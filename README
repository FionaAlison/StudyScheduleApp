Installation
Prerequisites
Docker: To build and run containerized services.
Kubernetes: For orchestrating microservices and deployment.
Windows Host File Update: Ensure that the application runs
 correctly by updating your hosts file in Windows to resolve internal service URLs by mapping "127.0.0.1  studyapp.local".
 This step ensures that the backend services can be accessed via their respective local domains, e.g., http://studyapp.local instead of localhost:port.
